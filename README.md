# Pulsar-Stars-classification
Identifying Pulsar Stars in a dataset of astronomical objects with Anomaly Detection algorithm using Gaussian Distribution.

## Description
The dataset contains only a few entries of Pulsar-Stars(1639:Positive, 16259:Negative). Considering those as anomalies, built a model to fit the non-anomalous data using 
Gaussian-Distribution. The training set only consists of non-anamolous examples while the Cross-Validation and Test sets consists of both the anomalous and non-anomalous
data for evaluation. Trained a model on the non-anamolous training data achieving the F1-Score of 0.8917 on test set.
